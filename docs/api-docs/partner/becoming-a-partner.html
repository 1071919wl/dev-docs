<p>Our BigCommerce partner program includes access to training, sales enablement, and a referral network to get more clients and build better ecommerce experiences.</p>
<p>The following sections outline the steps required to sell single-click apps in the <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps">BigCommerce App Marketplace</a>. Doing so requires a partnership application and acceptance will authorize you to provide best-of-breed solutions to the fast-growing online businesses we host.</p>
<h2 id="applying-to-the-technology-partner-program">Applying to the technology partner program</h2>
<p>Before you can submit an app to the BigCommerce App Marketplace, also known as the App Store, you must become an official partner. BigCommerce offers app developers free sandbox stores through its Technology Partner Program. To be approved as a partner, you will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A website showcasing your agency or technology solution</li>
<li>Intent to offer your app publicly</li>
<li>Ability to support your app's users</li>
<li>Evidence of expertise in app development</li>
</ul>
<p>The following steps outline how to become a BigCommerce Partner:</p>
<h2 id="becoming-a-partner-1">Becoming a partner</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Go to the <a href="https://partners.bigcommerce.com/">Partner Portal</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click <strong>Apply Today</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigcommerce/dev-docs/master/assets/images/becoming-a-partner-01.png" alt="Partner Apply" title="Partner Apply"></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Enter your company email address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click the <strong>Technology Partner Program</strong> button.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigcommerce/dev-docs/master/assets/images/becoming-a-partner-02.png" alt="Partner Registration" title="Partner Registration"></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Complete the member registration.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Complete Registration</strong> button.</li>
<li>Once your application is approved, check your email for your partner ID.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once approved, you will receive one or more emails listing your partner credentials and next steps. Your <strong>partner ID</strong> will be required to submit your app for App Marketplace consideration. If you do not receive these credentials by email, please contact <a href="mailto:appstore@bigcommerce.com">appstore@bigcommerce.com</a>.</p>
<h2 id="getting-a-sandbox-store">Getting a sandbox store</h2>
<p>To build a Marketplace app, you will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A sandbox store</li>
<li>A developer account on the <a href="https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/my/apps">BigCommerce Developer Portal</a>*</li>
<li>BigCommerce partner credentials</li>
</ul>
<p>We encourage you to create your sandbox store and your Dev Tools account using the same login credentials. A sandbox store cannot process transactions and is for developing and testing apps without the 15-day time limit of a trial store.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your Developer Portal account is an entirely separate account outside of the Partner Portal.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Although a sandbox store is not required for app development, it is best practice. If you opt to develop on a trial store, keep in mind the store and data will be erased after 15 days and you will have to create a new trial store to proceed</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-sandbox-store">Creating a sandbox store</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Go to the <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/essentials/pricing/">BigCommerce Pricing</a> page and select <strong>Start your free trial</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When prompted for an email address, enter the <em>same</em> email you used when applying to become a partner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the trial store setup form, enter a store name, password, and other details. Then select <strong>Create your store</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Log into your Partner account to access the <a href="https://partners.bigcommerce.com">Partner Portal</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Navigate to <strong>Support &gt; Contact Support</strong> and select <strong>Create a Support Case</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While completing the form, use &quot;Partner Sandbox&quot; as the subject line. In the case description, enter your new sandbox store’s canonical URL (for example: <a href="http://your-store-name.mybigcommerce.com">http://your-store-name.mybigcommerce.com</a>) and request conversion to a sandbox.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under <strong>Issue Type</strong>, select <strong>Merchant Account Services</strong>. Click <strong>Create Case</strong>. We will flag this new trial store as a sandbox to ensure your store access continues beyond the 15-day trial period. This process can take several days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Log into your new trial store using the same email associated with your partner login.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<p><strong>Are all fields required when applying to become a partner?</strong></p>
<p>We highly recommend filling out all the fields associated with publishing edits for your listing. Without filling in all fields, your listing will lack information merchants are accustomed to seeing on other listings and expect to see throughout the Marketplace.</p>
<p><strong>I’ve logged into Dev Tools, but I don’t see my published listing. Where is it?</strong></p>
<p>You may be logged in with the wrong account. Each listing can only be owned by one user, so it is likely assigned to another email address. If you’re unable to track down the correct owner account for your solution, please reach out to <a href="mailto:appstore@bigcommerce.com">appstore@bigcommerce.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Why doesn't my listing in the App Marketplace reflect changes I've made?</strong></p>
<p>The changes will be effective immediately in your control panel app card, but the updates can take up to 24 hours to appear on the public BigCommerce Marketplace. Feel free to use this as a grace period to make additional edits as needed.</p>
<p><strong>Who should I contact if I have further questions?</strong></p>
<p>If you have additional questions, email <a href="mailto:appstore@bigcommerce.com">appstore@bigcommerce.com</a>.</p>
